# Angle
A new tool for validating theoretically derived anisotropic displacement parameters with experiment.

This python program is used to determine the angles and therefore the agreement between the eigenvectors of theoretical and experimental thermal ellipsoids. The ADPs (anisotropic displacement parameters) are an important quantity during the refinement of crystal structures. 
For this you will need DFT-programs, such as [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/) and [Phonopy](https://github.com/atztogo/phonopy).
