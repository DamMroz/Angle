# Angle
A new tool for validating theoretically derived anisotropic displacement parameters with experiment

This python program is used to determine the angles between the eigenvectors of theoretical and experimental thermal ellipsoids. The ADPs (anisotropic displacement parameters) are an important quantity during the refinement of crystal structures. Theoretical insight can therefore help the experimentalists.
